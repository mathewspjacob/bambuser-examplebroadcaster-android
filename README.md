  <h1>Bambuser broadcast SDK for Android sample code</h1>
</div>

Sample code for broadcasting using the Bambuser broadcast SDK for Android.

The sample code in this project contains the bare minimum required to start broadcasting.


## Getting started

1. Install Android Studio.
2. Clone the sample code from this repository, so you have a local directory named i.e. `ExampleBroadcaster`.
3. Sign up for an account on https://bambuser.com if you don't already have one.
4. Download the Android SDK zip from https://dashboard.bambuser.com/developer and open the zip file.
5. Copy the `libbambuser-x.x.x.aar` file to the `ExampleBroadcaster/libbambuser` folder.
6. Import the `ExampleBroadcaster` project in Android Studio.
7. Edit `ExampleBroadcaster/libbambuser/build.gradle` and point it to the version of the `.aar` file.
8. Generate an `applicationId` at https://dashboard.bambuser.com/developer
9. Open the `MainActivity.java` file in Android Studio and insert the `applicationId` generated above.
10. Run the sample code on your device and start a broadcast. The broadcast should show up on https://dashboard.bambuser.com/content
